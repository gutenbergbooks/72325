<p>Frank and Flora Lee, with
Charley Green and his two
sisters, Katy and Nellie, had
gone out to spend the afternoon
in the pasture. It was
July, and the strawberries in
the fields were ripe. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
children had brought their tin
pails with them, and they
hoped to be able to fill them
with berries before they went
home.</p>

<p>The afternoon was quite
warm, and they soon got tired
of running after strawberries,
for there were very few in the
field. Seating themselves under
the broad branches of an oak,
they rested their weary limbs,
cooled their heated blood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
ate up the few berries that
they had picked.</p>

<p>The pasture was on the outskirts
of the village, and next
to the river. On one side of
it was an old, unpainted house,
in which lived a man by the
name of Benjamin Gorham.
He was a poor man, but he
was as proud as he was poor.
He had been a sailor nearly
all his lifetime. He was too
old to go to sea now, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
come to Riverdale to end his
days in peace and quiet.</p>

<p>He had bought the old house
in which he lived, together with
the few acres of land around
it. He had very little money,
and the people of Riverdale
thought he must have a hard
time to get along. He worked
on the land, and raised fruits
and vegetables, which he sold
in the village.</p>

<p>It seemed very sad for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
old man like him to work so
hard for a living. The town,
or the people, of Riverdale
would very gladly have helped
him with money or provisions,
but he was too proud to take
any thing from them. People
pitied him, and wanted to do
something for him; but he was
angry when any one offered
to give him any thing.</p>

<p>The folks in Riverdale had
a habit of calling Mr. Gorham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Uncle Ben, though for what
reason I am unable to say; for
not many of them liked him
very well, and when any of
the children came upon his
land, he drove them away.
He was cross, and scolded a
great deal more than was
necessary.</p>

<p>But the world had used him
rather badly, judging from his
own talk. He had worked
hard all his life, and now, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
he was an old man, he had
not enough to live upon without
severe toil. I suppose this
was what made him cross.
He thought people pitied him,
and he did not want to be
pitied, because he was very
proud.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben had not always
been a common sailor while
at sea. He had been the first
mate of a ship—which is next
to the captain—the two last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
voyages he had made. He
had wanted to be a captain,
but the owners, for some reason
or other, would not trust
him.</p>

<p>This made him gloomy and
sad. He was disappointed, and
this helped to make him cross.
People used to vex and bother
him, too, because he was so
crusty, and this only made him
worse. His wife was a very
good woman, and all the neighbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
liked her very much.
They had no children.</p>

<p>The happy party were seated
only a little way from the
house of Uncle Ben; but the
two boys thought they were
as near as they wanted to be,
for the old man seemed to hate
children.</p>

<p>If he did, it was only because
they gave him so much
trouble. They knew he was
cross, and they liked to plague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
him. On purpose to bother
him, they used to steal his
apples, even when they had
enough of them. They would
get into his lot, or his garden,
only to see him run after
them.</p>

<p>This was very naughty of
them, for I have no doubt, if
they had been kind to him, he
would have been kind to them.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a drink of
water,” said Flora Lee, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
glanced at the house of Uncle
Ben. “I’m almost choked.”</p>

<p>“We can get some at the
spring,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, but the spring is clear
out at the other end of the
pasture,” added Charley.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we get some
water at Uncle Ben’s?” asked
Flora.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t let you step
on his land. He is a cross
old fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Why, he would let me
have some water. Of course
he would,” added Flora.</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t; he drives
the fellows off when they come
near his house,” said Charley
Green.</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure, if I should
ask him, he would give me
some water.”</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t; he would
drive you off, just as he has
hundreds of others. There he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
is now, in the garden, picking
his currants,” replied Charley,
pointing to the place where
the currant bushes lined the
fence.</p>

<p>“I heard my father say the
boys plague him almost to
death; and that must be the
reason why he is so cross.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but he is as
cross as he can be, whatever
the reason is.”</p>

<p>“Poor old man! It is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
bad for the boys to plague him.
They say he has been all over
the world, and sailed upon all
the oceans.”</p>

<p>“I know he has,” added
Charley. “He told my father
something about one of his
voyages. Father says he likes
to tell stories when he can get
any one to hear him.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear him,”
said Flora; “I could sit all
the afternoon and listen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
stories about the sea; about
sailors and such things.”</p>

<p>“So could I.”</p>

<p>“I am going down to his
house to get a drink of water,”
continued Flora.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go there,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of him,”
replied the brave little girl.
“I will be kind to him, and I
know he won’t hurt me. I
don’t believe he will even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
scold at me. If he does I
can go away, you know.”</p>

<p>“Better go to the spring.”</p>

<p>“Besides, when I get down
there, I mean to ask him to
tell us a story.”</p>

<p>“He will bite your head off
if you do,” said Katy Green.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will; at
any rate, I shall try him. If
you don’t want to go, you
may stay where you are.”</p>

<p>“I will go, too,” said Nellie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The children talked it over
a little while, and they concluded
that Flora and Nellie
should go alone, and that
the others should wait in the
road for them.</p>

<p>So they went down the hill
into the road, and the three
who were to wait seated themselves
under a tree near the
house. The two little girls
walked on, and entered the
yard in front of the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Uncle Ben was picking currants,
not far off, and they
made their way to the spot,
being very careful not to tread
upon any of the plants.</p>

<p>As they came near to the
old man, he heard their steps,
and turned to see who they
were. He looked very sour
and cross, and Flora began to
have some doubts in regard
to her mission, which was not
only to get some water, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
see if Uncle Ben would not
speak kindly to her. He did
not look as if he could speak
a pleasant word, even if he
tried ever so hard.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?”
growled the old man, in a tone
that made the little girls tremble
with fear.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, I am very dry.
Will you please to let me
have a drink of water?”</p>

<p>“There is the well; you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
help yourself,” replied Uncle
Ben, in much gentler tones
than before.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; we won’t
tread on any thing, nor do a
bit of harm.”</p>

<p>Flora thought Uncle Ben
was trying to smile as she
turned to go; but she was certain
he did not smile. For my
part I don’t see how he could
help smiling, when he looked
upon such a good girl as Flora.</p>

<p>When Flora and Nellie arrived
at the well, there was
no water in the bucket. It
was drawn with a long pole,
called a “sweep,” supported
on a crotched post. The
bucket was attached to a
small pole, fastened to the end
of the long one, which went
down into the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>As the bucket went down,
one end of the long pole came
down with it, while the other
end went up—just as the
beam does in a pair of scales.
It was hard work to draw
water with a sweep, and the
little girls found that the
strength of both of them was
not enough to move it.</p>

<p>While they were trying, they
saw Uncle Ben leave his work,
and walk over to the well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
They wondered what he was
coming for, as they could not
believe that one so cross as
people said he was would
think of helping them.</p>

<p>“That is rather too hard
work for such little girls,”
said he, as he pulled down
the sweep, and then drew up
the bucket full of water.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Flora.
“You are so kind!”</p>

<p>“What is your name, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
little girl?” asked Uncle Ben,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Flora Lee, sir; and this is
Nellie Green.”</p>

<p>“You have been in the pasture—haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; we have been
trying to find some strawberries,
but they were so scarce
we couldn’t get many,” replied
Flora, when she had
taken a good drink of the
pure cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“There were more of you,
I thought.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; my brother and
Nellie’s brother and sister are
waiting for us out there in the
road.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you where you
can find plenty of strawberries,”
said Uncle Ben; and
now, without a doubt, there
was a smile on his wrinkled
face.</p>

<p>“O, thank you, sir!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Flora, with childlike
pleasure.</p>

<p>“In my pasture, on the
other side of the road, there
are oceans of them.”</p>

<p>“But will you let us pick
them, sir?”</p>

<p>“You may; when that Joe
Birch and such boys as he
come round here, I always
send them off, because they
steal my fruit, and break down
my fences. They are very bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
boys,” replied Uncle Ben, who
seemed to feel the need of
telling them why he was so
cross.</p>

<p>“Uncle”—Flora was going
to say “Uncle Ben;” but
she did not know that it would
be quite proper for her to call
him by this name.</p>

<p>“That’s right, little lady;
call me ‘Uncle Ben.’ You
needn’t be at all afraid of
me. That’s just what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
sailors used to call me on
board ship.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was going
to say, Uncle Ben. People
say you have been all over
the world.”</p>

<p>“I have, almost.”</p>

<p>“We should dearly like to
have you tell us some stories
about the sea, and places
where you have been.”</p>

<p>“I will do so, with pleasure,”
answered the old man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
with a smile—and so pleasant
a smile that Flora and
Nellie could hardly believe
he was the man whom folks
talked about so badly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. How kind
you are! Will you tell us
one now?”</p>

<p>“I can’t very well, now. I
have half a bushel of currants
to pick before sundown.”</p>

<p>“O, we will all help you,
Uncle Ben, if you will only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
tell us a sea story—won’t we,
Nellie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will; there are
five of us, and we can pick
them as fast as any thing.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please, little
misses.”</p>

<p>“We will go and call Frank,
and Charley, and Katy,” shouted
Flora, as she ran out of the
yard, followed by Nellie.</p>

<p>They were much pleased
with the success of their mission.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
They felt as smart as
though they had conquered
a wild tiger. They were sure
now that Uncle Ben did not
hate children, as people said
he did.</p>

<p>The old man had his faults,
and they were serious faults
too; but he was not half so
bad as folks said he was. He
was cross, very cross, at times,
and this made others impose
upon him. When he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
people were against him, without
stopping to ask the reason,
he began to hate them.</p>

<p>Things of this kind almost
always go on from bad to
worse; and the more folks
“picked upon him,” the more
he hated them. The boys,
and even the girls, who lived
near him, used to insult him,
when they dared to do so.
All these things put together
made him very unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>The children under the tree
jumped up when they saw
Flora and Nellie running towards
them so fast; and they
at once concluded that Uncle
Ben must have driven them
out of his yard.</p>

<p>“I knew he would,” said
Charley.</p>

<p>“So did I,” added Katy;
“and they were fools to go
near him.”</p>

<p>“So you have come, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
last?” continued Charley, as
the two little girls reached
the tree.</p>

<p>“Yes; and got driven away,
as I knew you would,” said
Katy.</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t get driven
away,” puffed Flora, out of
breath with running.</p>

<p>“Didn’t he send you off?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Indeed he did not,” answered
Flora. “I don’t care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
what any body says about
Uncle Ben; I say he is a
real nice man—isn’t he, Nellie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is.”</p>

<p>“He is enough sight better
than some of the folks that
talk about him. I like him
ever so much—don’t you,
Nellie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I do!”</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it,” said
Charley. “Did he scold at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
you any? Wasn’t he cross
and ugly?”</p>

<p>“He spoke cross when we
first went to him; but after I
asked him if I might have
some water, he was just as
good as pie,” replied Flora.</p>

<p>“What did you say to
him?”</p>

<p>“I only asked him if he
would please to let me have
some water. He said I might;
and when we couldn’t draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the water ourselves, he came
and drew it for us.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Ben did?” exclaimed
Charley.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed he did,” replied
Nellie.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall give up now!
Only think of Uncle Ben drawing
a bucket of water for you!”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he?” asked
Flora.</p>

<p>“He should, but I don’t believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
he will get over it for a
month. He will certainly have
a fit after it.”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t,” said Flora,
smartly. “And I haven’t told
you the whole yet.”</p>

<p>“What else? Wonders will
never cease after this,” laughed
Frank.</p>

<p>“When I had taken a good
drink of the water, I asked
Uncle Ben if he wouldn’t tell
us a story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“And he told you he
would?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“That will be first rate!”
exclaimed Katy; “I do like to
hear stories.”</p>

<p>“When will he tell us one?”</p>

<p>“I asked him if he wouldn’t
tell us one now. And he said
he would, only he had to pick
half a bushel of currants before
sundown. What do you
think I told him then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know; what did
you tell him?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“I told him we would all
help him. You will—won’t
you?”</p>

<p>They all, even Katy, who
was not often willing to do
what her friends asked her to
do, declared that they would.</p>

<p>They were so pleased at
the idea of a story from Uncle
Ben, that they were willing
to buy the pleasure by picking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
his currants for him. Flora
led the way back to the old
man’s house. He met them
with a smile on his face, and
led them out to the bushes,
where they went to work.</p>

<p>It turned out that Uncle
Ben had picked more than
half the currants he wanted
himself, and in less than half
an hour the busy fingers of
the children had finished the
job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Ben then led them to
an apple tree near the house.
Seating himself on the ground,
the children gathered around
him, and he began the story.
The little folks could scarcely
believe that he was the cross
old man, whom almost every
body hated, for he looked as
good natured as any body
could look.</p>

<p>I have no doubt my little

<h3>UNCLE BEN’S STORY.</h3>

<p>“When I was a young
man, I went out on a whaling
voyage. I suppose you don’t
know much about whaling; so
I will tell you. The oil which
you burn in your lamps is the
fat of the whale. It is ‘tried
out,’ just as they do hog’s fat.</p>

<p>“A whale is a great big
fish; some of them are a good
deal longer than my barn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
there. Ships that go out to
catch whales are often three
or four years away from home,
and go off thousands of miles.</p>

<p>“The ship has a great many
boats, which are hoisted up at
the sides. The men go out
in the boats, and when they
catch a whale, tow it to the
ship.</p>

<p>“Almost up at the top of
the mast, and more than a
hundred feet from the water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
there are two sticks, which
are called the cross-trees.
When the ship reaches any
part of the ocean where whales
are found, men are sent up to
the cross-trees to look out.</p>

<p>“When a whale is seen, one
of the men calls out, ‘There
she blows!’ This great fish
draws water into his mouth,
and then blows it up in the
air; and this is what they
mean by ‘blowing.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“When the men on deck
hear this cry, they find out
where the whale is, and then
get out the boats and go after
him. They row up to the
huge monster of the deep with
very little noise, and then
throw one or two harpoons
into him.</p>

<p>“A harpoon is a kind of
iron spear, with a wooden
handle, to which a long rope
is fastened. When the whale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
feels the iron, he dives down
into the deep, or runs away
as fast as he can. Sometimes
he drags the boat after him at
a frightful speed, for many
miles; and it often happens
that the men in the boat have
to cut the line, in order to
saves their lives.</p>

<p>“When the whale is weak
from loss of blood, and tired
out, the boat again steals upon
him, and a long lance is thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
into his body. This kills him,
if it is well done.</p>

<p>“Very often, when the men
attack the whale, he turns
upon the boat, and breaks it
all to pieces with a single
slap of his tail, or crushes it
all to bits in his monstrous
mouth. The sailors always
have a hard time, and are
often killed, in their efforts
to conquer the whale.</p>

<p>“When they get the whale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
alongside the ship, they cut
out the fat, or ‘blubber,’ in
long strips, and hoist it on
board the vessel. It is then
chopped up in small pieces,
and tried out in great kettles.
The oil is put in barrels, and
stowed in the hold.</p>

<p>“I have told you how to
catch a whale, so that you
may understand the story
which I am now going to
tell you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“I sailed in the ship Jane,
for the South Pacific Ocean,
long before any of you were
born; and I guess it was before
either of your fathers was
born. We went round Cape
Horn, which is a very stormy
place, and came near being
cast away in a heavy gale.</p>

<p>“But when we got into
the Pacific Ocean we had fine
weather, and at last reached
the ‘feeding ground.’ Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the whale is a monstrous creature,
he feeds upon animals
called ‘squid,’ and small fishes.
Of course he must live where
he can find his food.</p>

<p>“One day I was up on the
cross-trees, looking out on the
ocean for whales. I had with
me a boy of about twelve
years of age. He was as pretty
a boy as ever I saw. He
had fair, brown hair, which
curled in beautiful ringlets on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
his cheeks and neck, just as
Miss Flora’s does, only it was
not so long.</p>

<p>“We all loved that boy, for
he was a brave and noble little
fellow. He was gentle
and kind to the men, and always
obeyed the orders of the
officers at once. He was our
pet, and we all treated him
just like a younger brother.</p>

<p>“He could read well, and
wrote a handsome hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
when he first came on board
the ship, I knew he couldn’t be
the son of very poor parents,
for he did not speak like boys
brought up in the street, and
his hand was as white and
soft as that of a fine lady.</p>

<p>“One day I was up on the
cross-trees, and George was
with me, as I said before.
We were on the lookout for
whales, and he was just as
anxious to discover one as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
though he had been the captain
of the ship. He had no
hat on then, and his pretty
brown locks blew out in the
wind, just like Miss Flora’s
here.</p>

<p>“Says I, ‘George, why did
you come to sea?’</p>

<p>“‘Because I wanted to, of
course,’ replied he. ‘What
makes you ask that question?’</p>

<p>“‘Does your mother know
where you are, George?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“He looked sad when I
spoke of his mother. I knew
very well he must have run
away from home, for a boy
with such nice white hands
as he had when he came
aboard the ship, had no need
to go to sea. He had never
been brought up to work, but
he never grumbled once at
his duty, or the coarse food
of the sailor.</p>

<p>“‘Ah, George,’ I said, ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
am afraid you ran away from
your mother.’</p>

<p>“‘I did, Ben.’</p>

<p>“‘Haven’t you sent her a
letter, so that she may know
where you are?’</p>

<p>“‘No; I would not have
her know I am aboard a whale
ship for all the world,’ said
he; and I was sure by the
sad look on his face that he
was sorry for what he had
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“‘But you must write to
her, George, the very first
chance you get.’</p>

<p>“‘I can’t do that, Ben. It
would kill her to know where
I am. I have heard her say
a great many times that she
had rather lay me in the grave
than have me go to sea in a
whale ship.’</p>

<p>“‘But only think of her living
for two or three years
without knowing where you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
are! No doubt she wets her
pillow with tears every night
as she thinks of you. No,
George; you must write to
her, and let her know that
you are alive and well. You
can say in the letter that you
are in a good ship, among
good friends, and promise her
that you will be a good boy.
Perhaps she will feel easier
then.’</p>

<p>“‘I can’t write to her, Ben.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“‘But you must, my boy.
If you don’t, I shall write to
her by the first return ship I
can find.’</p>

<p>“‘Please don’t; she will feel
a great deal worse if you
write.’</p>

<p>“‘I will not, if you will
promise to write yourself.’</p>

<p>“‘I will, then. I don’t like
to, though.’</p>

<p>“I could not bear the idea
of having the little fellow’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
mother pining over him for
years, and I knew she would
feel better to know he was
alive, even if he was in a
whale ship.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon after we had
this talk, I saw a whale far
off on the sea. In a few minutes
we had a boat out, and
George and I were pulling
away towards the great fish.—There
comes Mr. Jones for
the currants, and I will tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
you the rest of the story as
soon as I have put them in
his wagon.”</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was absent but
a few moments; yet it seemed
like a long while to the children,
who were very anxious
to hear the rest of the story
about the handsome sailor
boy.</p>

<p>“Let me see—where did I
leave off?” said Uncle Ben, as
he again took his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“You were just going away
in the boat after the whale,”
replied Flora.</p>

<p>“So I was. Well, we rowed
close up to the whale, and
sent one iron into him. Before
we could strike him again,
he turned upon us, and with
one blow smashed our frail
boat all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed little
Flora, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Another boat from the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
picked us up. George was a
good swimmer, but I saw that
he was sinking this time, and
I bore him up in my arms, till
he was taken into the boat.
I found that he was badly hurt,
for his face was deadly pale,
and he was so faint he could
hardly speak. We had lost
the whale; so we went back
to the ship.</p>

<p>“I carried George in my
arms to the deck, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
bore him to his bunk in the
forecastle.</p>

<p>“That was a room to sleep
in—wasn’t it?” asked Nellie.</p>

<p>“Yes, child, but it wasn’t
any such place as your chamber.
It was cold, dark, and
damp. I laid the poor boy
in his bunk, and tried to find
out where he was hurt; but
he was so weak he could tell
me nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“If he had been my own
son, I could not have felt any
worse. I could not help thinking
of his poor mother, as I
sat by the side of his bunk,
watching over him. What
would she have said if she
could see her darling child,
sick in that dirty, dark place?
How she would have wept!</p>

<p>“I did not think poor George
was very badly hurt; I did not
want to think so, and I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
this is the reason why I
did not. The captain went
down to see him, and then
got some medicine for him.</p>

<p>“In the evening he seemed
to be a little better, and I
hoped he would be well in a
day or two. He talked a little
with me, and told me where
his pains were. He spoke of
his mother and his home, and
seemed to feel very sad to be
so far away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“I sat by his side till eight
bells—that is, till twelve o’clock.
He slept much of the
time, and as I bent over him
and listened to his quiet breathing,
I thought he was better,
and that he would be able to
go on deck the next day.</p>

<p>“You don’t know much
about the life of a whaler, I
suppose; so you can’t tell how
tired and worn out he gets
sometimes. The boats are often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
out all night, and the men
have to row, when they are so
sleepy and tired that they can
hardly hold their heads up.</p>

<p>“Well, I had been out in the
boat all the night before, and
I was just as tired as a man
could be. I could hardly keep
my eyes open, as I sat at the
side of the poor sick boy; but
I did not once lose myself
while I was on this duty.</p>

<p>“At twelve o’clock, finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
that George slept easily, I
called one of my shipmates to
take my place. He was very
willing to do so; but before I
left him, I charged him, over
and over again, to keep awake
and mind the boy. He promised
me he would, and I went
to my bunk.</p>

<p>“I was so tired that I slept
like a rock till eight bells,
which was four o’clock in the
morning. My first thought was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of poor George, and jumping
out of my berth, I hastened to
his side. My shipmate whom
I had left to watch him was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>“I felt so very angry with
him, that only my desire to
learn how the sick boy was,
prevented me from kicking
him out of the forecastle. I
looked into the bunk, and all
was still as when I had left,
and I thought he was asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“All was still and calm in
the berth—so still and calm
that I trembled with fear. I
listened to hear his breathing,
but no sound reached my ear.
I then placed my hand upon
his brow. It was as cold as
marble.</p>

<p>“Poor George was dead!</p>

<p>“O children, I can’t tell you
how I felt then. It seemed
just as though our angel had
been taken out of the ship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
I wept as I should have wept
if he had been my son or my
brother.</p>

<p>“From that sleep in which
I had left him he had never
awakened, for he lay just as
he was at midnight. There
was not a dry eye in the ship
when it was told that poor
George, whom we all loved,
was dead.</p>

<p>“We dressed him in his
clean clothes, and bore his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
body upon deck, where we
covered it with the American
flag. At noon the sad cry of
‘All hands to bury the dead’
sounded gloomily through the
ship.</p>

<p>“The body of poor George,
sewed up in a piece of sailcloth,
was placed on a plank,
still covered with the American
flag. It was raised upon
the rail, ready to be cast into
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“The captain, with his eyes
brim full of tears, and hardly
able to speak from grief, read
prayers; and all was ready to
launch the body into the deep.
The canvas had been left open
at the head, and the wind blew
the fair brown locks upon the
cold brow of poor George, just
as when he had stood by my
side on the cross-trees.</p>

<p>“One by one the sailors
kissed his marble cheeks,—kissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
him for his mother,—and
wiped the tears from their
brown faces. The canvas was
sewed up, the word was given,
and the body slid off the plank
into the great ocean, there to
sleep till the graves give up
their dead.</p>

<p>“The ship filled away upon
her course, and it was many
and many a day before we
ceased to think of the poor
sailor boy in his ocean grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“When I got home, I went
to New York to see poor
George’s mother. I found her
without trouble, and told her
the story of her lost child. A
few days after she was taken
to an insane asylum, where
she died. Poor George! Poor
mother!”</p>

<p>Every one of the children
was crying when Uncle Ben
finished his story, and even
when they went home, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
eyes were red and swollen
with weeping.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Flora?”
asked Mrs. Lee, when
her two children entered the
house.</p>

<p>“Nothing, mother.”</p>

<p>“Why, both of you have
been crying! What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, mother; only Uncle
Ben has been telling us a
very sad story about a handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
sailor boy, who was
killed at sea by a whale,”
replied Frank.</p>

<p>“Who told you the story—Uncle
Ben?” asked Mrs. Lee,
very much surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” replied Flora.
“He is a real nice man,
and not a bit cross when you
don’t bother him.”</p>

<p>The children told their father
and mother all about the
events of the afternoon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
how kind Uncle Ben had been
to them. Mr. Lee was very
much pleased, as well as surprised,
for he looked upon Uncle
Ben just as nearly all the
people of Riverdale did—as
a hard and cross man.</p>

<p>But after what the children
had told him, he felt very
kindly towards the old man,
and wanted to do something
for him, so that he need not
have to work so hard. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
went to see Uncle Ben the
next day, and told him how
pleased the children had been
with him.</p>

<p>A few months after this
event Mr. Lee, with the help
of his friends, got the place
of Postmaster of Riverdale for
Uncle Ben, and the old man
sold his farm and moved into
the village. This place gave
him money enough to live
without hard work. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
got it by being kind to the children,
and after this he tried
very hard to be kind to every
body.</p>

<p>So you see how much good
Flora did by going to Uncle
Ben in the right way. She
had conquered his cold heart,
and the old man, feeling how
much he owed to the children,
became a great favorite among
them.</p>

<p>Many a time, after Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Ben had sent off the mail, the
children gathered together in
the Post Office, to hear an
interesting story of the sea;
and even the old folks were
glad to listen to them.</p>
